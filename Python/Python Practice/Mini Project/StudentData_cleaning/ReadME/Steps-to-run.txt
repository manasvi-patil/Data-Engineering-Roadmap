Steps to run this project:

1. Add your student raw data csv in your "data -> input data" folder.
If the data is in excel format you can convert it to csv through "excel_to_csv.py" file.
2. Make changes in the config file, "config -> config.json" according to your recruitments (Changing the graduation year and allowed-locations)
3. In "main.py" file mention your input csv file path and your desired output csvs name.
4. The output will be stored in "data -> output data" folder and two csvs; valid_students and invalid_students will be stored separately.
